# Problem 1
# Create a tuple called colors with 3 colors.
# Print the first color and the last color.

colors = ("red", "orange", "blue")
print(colors[0])
print(colors[2])

# Problem 2
# Create a tuple called location with (city, state).
# Unpack it into city and state variables and print them.

location = ("Seattle", "Washington")
city, state = location
print("City:", city)
print("State:", state)

# Problem 3
# Create a list of tuples called points with 3 points:
# (0, 0), (2, 5), (4, 1)
# Loop through points and print each x and y.

l = [(0, 0), (2, 5), (4, 1)]
for p in l:
    print(p)

# Problem 4
# Ask the user for two numbers.
# Store them in a tuple and print the tuple.



# Problem 5
# Create a function called add_and_multiply(a, b).
# It should return (a + b, a * b) as a tuple.
# Call it and unpack the results, then print both.
